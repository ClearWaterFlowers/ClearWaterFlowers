            <span class="purple">By following these steps, you can successfully save flower seeds from your garden for future planting and propagation!</p>
            </span>
        <li><span class="pink">Selecting the Flowers:</span> Choose healthy, mature flowers from which to collect seeds. Look for
         flowers that are fully developed and have started to wilt or dry naturally on the plant. Avoid 
         collecting seeds from hybrid varieties, as they may not produce true-to-type plants.</li>
        
        <li><span class="pink">Allowing Seed Pods to Mature:</span> Let the flowers on your selected plants mature fully, allowing seed 
        pods to form. Seed pods are often located at the base of flowers or where the flowers were once at
        tached to the stem. Allow the seed pods to dry on the plant until they turn brown and begin to split open.</li>
        
       <li><span class="pink">Harvesting Seed Pods:</span> Once the seed pods have dried and begun to split open, carefully remove them 
        from the plant. Use scissors or pruners to snip off the seed pods, making sure to handle them gently
         to avoid damaging the seeds inside.</li>
        
       <li><span class="pink">Extracting Seeds:</span> Open the seed pods carefully and extract the seeds inside. Depending on the type of
         flower, the seeds may be nestled within the pod or dispersed throughout. Use your fingers or tweezers to
          remove the seeds, being careful not to crush or damage them.</li> 
        
        <li><span class="pink">Cleaning Seeds:</span> After extracting the seeds, remove any remaining plant material or debris from them. You 
        can do this by gently rubbing the seeds between your fingers or by winnowing them in front of a gentle 
        breeze. Be thorough in your cleaning to ensure that only seeds remain.</li>
        
        <li><span class="pink">Drying Seeds:</span> Spread the cleaned seeds out in a single layer on a paper towel or a fine mesh screen. Allow
         the seeds to air dry in a warm, well-ventilated area for several days to ensure that they are completely 
         dry before storage. Make sure to label the seeds with the name of the flower species and the date of collection.</li>
        
        <li><span class="pink">Storing Seeds:</span> Once the seeds are thoroughly dried, transfer them to airtight containers such as glass jars 
        or resealable plastic bags. Store the containers in a cool, dark, and dry location, such as a pantry or refrigerator.
         Properly stored flower seeds can remain viable for several years.</li>
